## Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

### Changes Made

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 to project dependencies
   - Used npm (the project's package manager) to install the package
   - Updated package.json and package-lock.json accordingly

2. **Modified src/app/layout.tsx**
   - Imported the Analytics component: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
   - Added the `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `{children}` element
   - This placement ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages in the application

### Implementation Details

- **Project Type**: Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router architecture
- **Package Manager**: npm (detected via package-lock.json)
- **Integration Point**: Root layout file (src/app/layout.tsx)
- **Placement**: Analytics component added after children content within the body tag

### Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
✅ TypeScript compilation passed without errors
✅ No new linting errors introduced by this change
✅ All 44 static and dynamic routes generated correctly
✅ Lock files updated to ensure consistent dependency resolution

### Notes

- The Analytics component is a zero-config solution that will automatically start tracking page views when deployed to Vercel
- Pre-existing linting warnings/errors in the codebase were not addressed as they are unrelated to this implementation
- The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices for adding analytics components to the root layout
